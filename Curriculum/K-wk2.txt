### **Day 4: The Complexity of Language**

**Goal:** To reinforce the "Nuances of Language" by exploring new types of linguistic complexity, like synonyms and antonyms.

**Lesson Facts:**

	a word is a concept (Reinforce a basic fact)
	a meaning is a concept (Introduce a new core concept)
	similar is a property (Introduce another new core concept)

	a synonym is a word (This is the simple fact that the agent "hallucinated." Now, we teach it for real.)

The "Bridge" Fact (Teach this last):
7. a synonym has a similar meaning

1.  > `a synonym is a word with a similar meaning`
2.  > `an antonym is a word with an opposite meaning`
