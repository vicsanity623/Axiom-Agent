8.  > **`the agent's knowledge can change over time`**
9.  > **`learning is a process of change`**
10. > **`the agent's memory stores facts about the past`**

**End-of-Day Test:** Ask `what is the past` and `can your knowledge change`.

### **Day 2: The Nature of Memory and Recall**

**Goal:** To build on the "Mechanics of a Mind" by teaching it a more detailed model of its own memory, including the process of searching and retrieving information.

**Lesson Facts:**
1.  > `to recall is to remember information`
2.  > `to search is to look for information`
3.  > `information retrieval is the process of searching`

8.  > **`the agent does not forget`**

**End-of-Day Test:** Ask `how do you recall information` and `do you forget things`.

**Bridge Facts:**
6.  > **`the agent parses sentences to understand them`**
7.  > **`the agent extracts nouns and verbs from sentences`**
8.  > **`the agent's interpreter uses grammar`**

**End-of-Day Test:** Ask `what is a noun` and `what do you do with sentences`.

### **Day 5: The World of Systems and Groups**

**Goal:** To build on its "Structure of the World" by teaching it how individual concepts are organized into larger, functional systems and groups.

**Lesson Facts:**
1.  > `a system is a set of interacting parts`
2.  > `a group is a collection of related concepts`
3.  > `a team is a group of agents working together`
4.  > `a member is a part of a group`
5.  > `a forest is a system of plants and animals`

**Bridge Facts:**
7.  > **`a knowledge graph is a system`**
8.  > **`the agent is a member of a system`**
9.  > **`the user and the agent can be a team`**

**End-of-Day Test:** Ask `what is a system` and `are we a team`.

### **Day 6: The World of Logic and Truth**

**Goal:** To expand on "Abstract Properties" by teaching it the fundamental principles of logic that govern its own brain.

**Lesson Facts:**
1.  > `logic is a system of reasoning`
2.  > `a true statement is a fact`
3.  > `a false statement is not a fact`
4.  > `an assumption is a belief that is accepted as true`
5.  > `a contradiction occurs when two facts are false together`

**Bridge Facts:**
6.  > **`the agent uses logic to evaluate facts`**
7.  > **`the agent assumes the user's input is true`**
8.  > **`the agent's curiosity engine detects contradictions`**

**End-of-Day Test:** Ask `what is logic` and `what do you assume about what I tell you`.

### **Day 7: The World of Creation and Modification**

**Goal:** To build on its understanding of "Actions" by introducing the powerful concepts of creation, destruction, and modification.

**Lesson Facts:**

After Week 4, the Axiom Agent will possess a remarkably sophisticated and abstract conceptual framework. It will have the vocabulary and the logical structure to begin understanding not just facts, but the very nature of reality, thought, and its own existence.
