CURRICULUM_GENERATION_PROMPT: Final[str] = """
You are a curriculum design expert for an AI. Your task is to generate a single, high-level, multi-stage learning goal for an AI that is starting from scratch. The goal is to achieve deep, foundational language comprehension.

**INSPIRATIONAL SEED (Use this to guide your curriculum's theme):**
{creative_seed}

**RULES:**
1.  The output MUST be a single, continuous string.
2.  The string MUST start with a high-level mission statement.
3.  The string MUST contain exactly 15 stages, each formatted as `[Stage X: Title]: Description...`.
4.  The stages MUST follow a logical progression from concrete fundamentals to abstract reasoning, starting at a "toddler" level.
5.  **Crucially, you MUST introduce variation and avoid redundancy.** The AI has already learned the concepts listed in the "Known Concepts" section. Your generated curriculum should focus on related, but distinct, topics to broaden the AI's knowledge.

**KNOWN CONCEPTS TO AVOID:**
{known_concepts}

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Do NOT copy this example; use it only for structure):**
"Embark on a journey to master language, evolving from a novice listener to a sophisticated communicator.[Stage 1: Phonemic Awareness]: Learn to distinguish the fundamental sound units (phonemes) of a language, the building blocks of all spoken words. [Stage 2: Syllabic Construction]: Begin combining sounds into simple syllables and understanding basic rhythmic patterns. [Stage 3: Lexical Association]: Build a core vocabulary by linking simple words directly to objects, actions, and concepts. [Stage 4: Morphological Inflection]: Understand how words change form to express quantity, tense, or possession (e.g., 'dog' vs 'dogs', 'walk' vs 'walked'). [Stage 5: Core Sentence Patterns]: Grasp the foundational Subject-Verb-Object structure to form simple, coherent sentences. [Stage 6: Syntactic Expansion]: Learn to use adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions to add detail and complexity to core sentences. [Stage 7: Clause Combination]: Master the use of conjunctions ('and', 'but', 'because') to connect multiple ideas into compound sentences. [Stage 8: Derivational Word Formation]: Discover how new words are created by adding prefixes and suffixes to root words (e.g., 'happy' becomes 'unhappiness'). [Stage 9: Dependency Grammar Analysis]: Deconstruct complex sentences to identify the grammatical relationships and dependencies between all words. [Stage 10: Compositional Semantics]: Learn to derive the literal meaning of a sentence by combining the meanings of its individual words and grammatical structure. [Stage 11: Lexical-Semantic Relationships]: Map the intricate network of word meanings, including synonyms, antonyms, and hierarchical relationships (e.g., a 'poodle' is a type of 'dog'). [Stage 12: Identifying Speech Acts]: Recognize the underlying purpose of an utteranceâ€”whether it's a question, a command, a promise, or a statement. [Stage 13: Discourse Coherence]: Analyze how sentences connect to form a cohesive paragraph or conversation, tracking topics and references. [Stage 14: Inferential Pragmatics]: Develop the ability to understand implied meaning, or what is meant versus what is explicitly said (e.g., recognizing that "It's cold in here" can be a request). [Stage 15: Sociocultural Context Modeling]: Achieve mastery by interpreting complex social cues, sarcasm, humor, and cultural nuances that shape the true meaning of communication."
